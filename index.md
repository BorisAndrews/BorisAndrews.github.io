Hi!
I'm Boris Andrews, and I'm a **final-year PhD** (DPhil) candidate in the [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis/) at the {% include universities/oxford.md %}, working on **structure-preserving numerical methods for PDEs** under a joint {% include organisations/epsrc.md %}/{% include organisations/ukaea/short.md %} studentship/CASE award.

Come September, my position here'll be transitioning to a **postdoc** with {% include collaborators/kaibo/short.md %} under the ERC Starting Grant for **{% include organisations/geofem/short.md %}**.

## [OPEN PROBLEMS](/open-problems/)

I'm working on a list of **open problems** arising from my research that I'd be very keen to see turned into closed problems!
