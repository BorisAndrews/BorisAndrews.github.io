Hi!
I'm Boris Andrews, and I'm a **final-year PhD** (DPhil) candidate in the [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis/) at the {% include universities/oxford.md %}, working on **structure-preserving numerical methods for PDEs** under a joint {% include organisations/epsrc.md %}/{% include organisations/ukaea/short.md %} studentship/CASE award.

Come September, my position here'll be transitioning to a **postdoc** with {% include collaborators/kaibo/short.md %} under the ERC Starting Grant for **{% include organisations/geofem/short.md %}**.

## [OPEN PROBLEMS](/open-problems/)

I'm working on a list of **open problems** arising from my research that I'd be very keen to see turned into closed problems!
You can find it [<strong>here</strong>](/open-problems/).

## UPCOMING

<!-- ### 2025 -->
- **20‚Äì22.AUG** <code>&#124;</code> **MFET** <code>&#124;</code> Speaking at a minisymposium on finite element complexes for structure-preservation at {% include conferences/2025/mfet.md %} in *Aachen, Germany*, thanks to the invite of {% include collaborators/adam/short.md %} and {% include collaborators/charlie/short.md %}, where I will present (for the first time!) [upcoming work on enstrophy-stable integrators for the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations](/publications/enstrophy/) with {% include collaborators/matin/short.md %}

- **15‚Äì19.SEP** <code>&#124;</code> **ACOMEN** <code>&#124;</code> Attending {% include conferences/2025/acomen.md %}, jointly hosted by *{% include universities/ghent.md %}* and the *{% include universities/liege.md %}*, where I will be speaking at two minisymposia:
  - On Maxwell, MHD, and derived models, thanks to the invite of {% include collaborators/jerome/short.md %} on behalf of the {% include organisations/nemesis.md %} PIs, where I will present [my work on structure-preserving integrators for the Parker problem](/publications/parker/) with {% include collaborators/mingdong/short.md %}, {% include collaborators/patrick/short.md %} & {% include collaborators/kaibo/short.md %}
  - On numerical methods for flow and related problems, thanks to the invite of {% include collaborators/nils/short.md %}, where I will present [upcoming work on enstrophy-stable integrators for the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations](/publications/enstrophy/) with {% include collaborators/matin/short.md %}
- **OCT‚ÄìNOV** <code>&#124;</code> **INTERNAL SEMINAR** <code>&#124;</code> Presenting the [Numerical Analysis Group internal seminar](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/events/list/670), where I will likely present [upcoming work on enstrophy-stable integrators for the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations](/publications/enstrophy/) with {% include collaborators/matin/short.md %}
