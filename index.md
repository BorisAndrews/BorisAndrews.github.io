Hi! I'm Boris Andrews, and I'm a **final-year PhD** (DPhil) candidate in the [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis/) at the {% include universities/oxford.md %}, working on **structure-preserving numerical methods for PDEs** under a joint {% include organisations/epsrc.md %}/{% include organisations/ukaea/short.md %} studentship/CASE award.
