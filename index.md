hi ! i'm boris andrews, and i'm a dphil (phd) student in the [numerical analysis research group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) at [university of oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) working on structure-preserving numerical methods for pdes, under a joint [epsrc](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) / [ccfe](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) studentship

<br>

# interests
- structure-preserving numerical methods for pdes
- finite element theory (incl. mgrit / feec)
- hybrid fluid-particle models
- turbulent systems (incl. stabilisation / preconditioning)
