# UNIFORMLY ACCURATE ASYMPTOTIC-PRESERVING INTEGRATORS FOR CHARGED PARTICLES

### Boris Andrews

### In preparation *(Draft available on request)*

*(Details available soon!)*

## RELATED WORKS

In my [earlier work](/publications/sp-integrators/) with {% include collaborators/patrick/short.md %}, we developed integrators for ODE systems that preserve arbitrarily many invariants.
This works uses the framework of this idea, but adapts it to the preservation of *adiabatic* invariants;
one adiabatic invariant in particular: the *magnetic moment*.
