> *[...] we propose an approach for the construction of timestepping schemes that preserve dissipation laws and conserve multiple general invariants, via finite elements in time and the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables. [...] We [devise] novel arbitrary-order schemes that conserve to machine precision all known invariants of Hamiltonian ODEs [...] and arbitrary-order schemes for the compressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations that conserve mass, momentum, and energy, and provably possess non-decreasing entropy.*
