# GLOBALLY AND LOCALLY STRUCTURE-PRESERVING MIXED FINITE ELEMENT METHODS FOR BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS

### Boris Andrews

### In preparation (Draft available on request)

*(Details available soon!)*

## RELATED WORKS

The ideas here, in particular the style of the framework and the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables, are highly **reminiscent of my earlier work** with {% include collaborators/patrick/short.md %}, on [general constructions for conservative finite element integrators](/publications/sp-integrators-a/).
In fact, one can view that earlier work as a special case of this, where one interprets the **initial condition** (in time) as a **boundary condition** (in space-time).
