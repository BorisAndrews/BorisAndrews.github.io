    "## **Weak solutions \\& the Onsager conjecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "All this *\"Euler's ill-posed\"* and *\"reconnection is possible in the inviscid limit\"* nonsense becomes can be made much more rigorous, with a careful consideration of the analysis of the Euler equations.\n",

    "### **The Onsager conjecture and dissipative anomalies**\n",
    "\n",
    "While a naïve reading of the Euler equations might make us think these equations should conserve energy, that's quite hard to prove for weak solutions.\n",
    "In fact, Lars Onsager conjectured in 1949 that, for weak solutions to the Euler equations to conserve energy, they must possess a certain regularity, specically a Hölder exponent $\\alpha > 1/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial data that is *\"rougher\"* than $\\alpha = 1/3$ is referred to as *\"wild\"* in the literature, which I think is a fun term we should use more!\n",
    "You can fix ideas when you hear people refer to wild initial data by thinking of the step function in the ideal Allen–Cahn equation;\n",
    "we don't know what's going on in that wild and rough jump, but we know it's going to play all sorts of tricks on our solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure enough, weak Euler solutions under wild initial data can dissipate kinetic energy, despite having zero viscosity.\n",
    "There is some kind of *\"invisible dissipation\"* that occurs within these sharp gradients.\n",
    "This relates to the idea that the limit of Navier–Stokes is, in some sense, a *\"wild, dissipative weak solution to Euler\"*, not a conservative classical one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Convex integration and non-uniqueness**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the ideal Allen–Cahn equation proposed above having infinitely many solutions (jumping around $u \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$), we can construct a continuum of weak solutions to the Euler equations under wild initial data.\n",
    "These constructions are less straightword forward than the Allen–Cahn constructions, using techniques I really do not understand called convex integration and Nash–Kuiper embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, one can construct wild solutions that are initially at rest, spontaneously start moving, and then stop, completely destroyed energy conservation, and giving whatever energy profile you might want.\n",
    "There's a physical implication here that, hidden in the roughness of your initial data, there's all sorts of behaviour, the manifestation of which you have complete agency over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, these continua of solutions have been referred to in the literature as *\"very weak\"*.\n",
    "The *\"ghost of viscosity\"* (a limit of $\\nu \\to 0_+$) is required to pick out the physically relevant solution."
