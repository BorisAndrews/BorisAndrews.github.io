# OPEN PROBLEMS & REWARDS

### a.k.a. Boris's BIG questions

(Intro)

(This is all stuff I'm not working on currently (got to keep the best ideas to myself))

(Contact me if you're working on/interested in any of these problems! I'd love to collab)

(What is this?)

(What are the rewards and how do I obtain them?)

(How do I rank hardness?)

(Reward options)
